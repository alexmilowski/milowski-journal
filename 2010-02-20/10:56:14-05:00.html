<h1>Web-based Editor for Atomojo</h1>
<p>I just finished a web-based editor for the Atom Publishing Protocol that is part of Atomojo.  I've also integrated it with the Atomojo server.  You can now just add the <code>edit-client='true'</code> attribute to any <code>host</code> or <code>resource</code> declaration in your <code>server.conf</code> and it will configure the editor on the <code>/edit/</code> path of your server.</p>
