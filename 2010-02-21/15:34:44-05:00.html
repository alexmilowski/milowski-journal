<h1>Using contenteditable in Atomojo's Editor</h1>
<p>I just added the use of WYSIWIG editing to the content editor for entries with XHTML content.  The <code>contenteditable='true'</code> is really simple and works very well in browsers like Safari or Firefox.  Given that I only use non-broken browsers to edit my feeds, this will work well.</p>
