<h1>WebKit MathML is Progressing</h1>
<p>I've been able to make some progress getting MathML into the trunk of <a href="http://www.webkit.org/">WebKit</a> .  You can see from the <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3251">master MathML Bug</a> that there are only a few patches that aren't in the trunk.  In fact, <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33703">33703</a> doesn't count because it is a union of other patches for others who want to play and is now almost obsolete.</p>
<p>Just <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34741"><code>mfrac</code> </a> , <code>mroot</code> , and <code>msqrt</code> to go and we'll have a some basic MathML that is usable.  There is, of course, quite a bit more to do.</p>
