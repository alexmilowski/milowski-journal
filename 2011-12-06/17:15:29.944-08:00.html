<h1>XProc on My Website</h1>
<p>I've migrated my whole website to run on a combination of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XProc">XProc</a> , <a href="http://www.restlet.org">Restlet</a> , and the new <a href="http://code.google.com/p/atomojo">Atomojo V2</a> server.  Atomojo V2 provides an Atom APP backend powered by XProc and <a href="http://www.marklogic.com">MarkLogic</a> glued together using Restlet.  The same archictecture has been use to deploy this website.  That is, almost all the pages are the result of running some XProc-enabled process.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks I'll be detailing how this whole system works.  I'll start with some simple examples.  In the end, I hope I'll have convinced you that XProc makes my life easier.  If not, well, you can walk away thinking: &quot;I hope he thinks so!&quot;</p>
