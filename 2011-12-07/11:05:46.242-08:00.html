<h1>Bad Choices in Forwards Compatibility within IE</h1>
<p>In the final throws of working on this website update, I had to go and test on different versions of IE.  I knew a lot of things were not going to work in anything before IE (Internet Explorer) 9.  Nevertheless, I needed something to show up for the poor folks still using a broken browser.</p>
<p>After fussing a bit with a post-process filter in Restlet, I adjusted the website to switch to the media type <code>text/html</code> when it detects any version of IE before 9.  The theory was that I could squeak by and deliver hacked up XHTML to IE and get something to render.  That theory was quite wrong.</p>
<p>See, folks, I use a variety of modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox), on a variety of operating systems (OS X, Android, iOS), on a variety of platforms (Mac, iPhone/iPod, Android Phones, Nook Tablets).  Everything works the way I expect it except on Windows with IE.  I knew that and I avoid bastardizing my projects just to make IE work.</p>
<p>The engineers that made IE made what I believe to be the worse decision in forwards compatibility I could imagine for any system that processes markup.  Instead of just ignoring tags it doesn't understand, it automatically closes them and makes the child a sibling.  This completely destroys any kind of forwards compability as the DOM used by the browser is now enormously different than expected.</p>
<p>For example, in my pages I use the HTML5 article structure.  Whenever an <code>article</code> , <code>section</code> , or other such HTML5 elements occurs, such as:</p>
<pre><code>
&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Test Article&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overview&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the beginning ...

</code></pre>
<p>in IE 8 or previous versions, you'll get:</p>
<pre><code>
&amp;lt;article/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Test Article&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;section/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Overview&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the beginning ...

</code></pre>
<p>As the containers are gone, the stylesheets won't work properly, and everything looks funny.</p>
