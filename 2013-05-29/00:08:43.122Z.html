<h1>Green Turtle 1.0 Released!</h1>
<p>I've just released 1.0 of <a href="https://code.google.com/p/green-turtle/">Green Turtle</a> . Â My implementation now passes <strong>all</strong> the tests in the W3C conformance test suite for both <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/">RDFa 1.1</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle</a> .</p>
<p>There is also a great new feature that integrates Turtle handling directly into the API and allows for automatic processing of embedded Turtle. Â This allows data providers to use RDFa or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#in-html">embedded Turtle</a> directly in their documents and Green Turtle will do the right thing!</p>
<p>Also, this release supports RDFa in HTML as specified in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-rdfa/">latest draft</a> and passes all the relevant tests for that processing mode.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/green-turtle/wiki/MicroAPI">the API</a> has been adjusted to allow direct access to representation parsers (e.g. Turtle). Â This feature allows a developer to retrieve or construct triples via a representation like Turtle and then merge them into the current document's data. Â As such, all the nice features of the RDFa API are available to the developer for Turtle as well.</p>
