<h1>Disk Soup: AWS, EBS, RAID, MarkLogic, and Pinch of Salt!</h1>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.marklogic.com/events/marklogic-world-2013/">2013 MarkLogic User Conference</a> , I learned all kinds of interesting and valuable information about running <a href="http://www.marklogic.com/">MarkLogic</a> on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS (Amazon Web Services) EC2 servers.</a> Most specifically, it was mentioned that I wasn't necessarily going to get a huge performance gain over regular EBS storage via the RAID 10 configuration that I cooked up. Â That was good news to me because it costs me quite a bit to have all that extra EBS storage for RAID10.</p>
<p>I just finally got around to testing all of this out with live data. Â I trimmed down my data, merged all my forests, and cleaned up the disk to ensure I knew exactly how much storage I needed. Â I finally got it all down to about 148GB of on-disk data for about 3+ months of weather data.</p>
<p>My current configuration is eight 200GB volumes arranged in a RAID 10 configuration. Â That is 1.6TB of storage that yields about 750GB of usable disk space.</p>
<p>To consolidate this onto one volume, I created a 600GB EBS volume, created an ext4 filesystem, and copied all the data across while everything was shutdown. Â And then I waited, and waited, copying is sure slow, and waited...</p>
<p>When I was finally ready, I started up MarkLogic and all my Web applications to test the throughput. Â The result: <strong>it was twice as slow!</strong> I get at least a 2 times increase in performance by having RAID10 via mdadm.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the data hadn't changed and so I could easily switch back to the old filesystem. Â I restarted MarkLogic and verified my measurements: <em>yes, RAID10/mdadm is better by at least twice.</em></p>
<p>I then looked into <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/07/31/announcing-provisioned-iops-for-amazon-ebs/">Provisioned IOPS</a> and whether I could test that. Â Unfortunately, it isn't available for the instance type I'm using ( <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#instance-details">m2.xlarge</a> ) and I would have to move to the next level up (m2.2xlarge). Â The additional cost of Provisioned IOPS for EBS and the m2.2xlarge removes any cost savings I might have had.</p>
<p>Here's the takeaway:</p>
<ul>
<li>RAID10 via mdadm is a good middle ground for AWS. Â It will give you better performance, possibly twice as fast as regular EBS storage.</li>
<li>RAID10 will cost you less for overall EBS storage than Provisioned IOPS.</li>
<li>Provisioned IOPS will give you better performance guarantees and you may find you want/need to pay for that.</li>
<li>I don't have a measurement of that as of yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish I had an easy way to test out Provisioned IOPS for EBS storage with my system. Â It would be great to compare everything all at once. Â Unfortunately, I would first have to upgrade to a different instance type and then re-run all the tests I've done so far. Â For my current work, that isn't necessary.</p>
<p>Yet, when I want more performance, I now know what to do next.</p>
