<p>It has been far too long since I've written about my research, past or present, and I need to correct that.  I've been rather silent over the past year or more â€” life has kept me busy with other things.  As such, I have a backlog of information.</p>
<p>I'm back at it and you'll see more from me.  Meanwhile, this entry is a bit of a retrospective of research from my <a href="https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/9957">Ph.D. dissertation</a> at the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/">University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics</a> as presented at the <a href="http://www.xmlprague.cz/archive/">XML Prague 2014 conference</a>.</p>
<p>My thinking has evolved.  I would use <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a> in addition to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-lite/">RDFa</a> which I will elucidate in a forthcoming post on my Semantic Hybridization idea.  Moreover, I would  enable <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/">CSV on the Web</a> as an additional way to transport tuples of data (rows).</p>
<p>I've included the presentation below and the <a href="http://archive.xmlprague.cz/2014/files/xmlprague-2014-proceedings.pdf">full conference paper</a> is available as well.  Enjoy!</p>
