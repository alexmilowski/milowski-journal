   schema:description "I have been rather silent for awhile and environment has everything to do with that.  Many startups work under the guise of secrecy and my day-to-day work kept me quite busy without much opportunity to communicate.  In my new endeavours at [Orange Silicon Valley](http://www.orangesv.com) (really, San Francisco) my role is a communicator of new and interesting things.  As such, keeping this blog up-to-date with what is rolling around in my mind is one aspect of that. " ;
