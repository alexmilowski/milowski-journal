<h1>SF Microservices Meetup - Going Serverless with Flask</h1>
<p>I gave a talk last night (July 11th, 2017) about deploying <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">python Flask-based</a> on
Serverless infrastructure.  You can view the slides <a href="https://alexmilowski.github.io/flask-serverless/going-serverless.html">here</a> and I will publish more notes on the github repository <a href="https://github.com/alexmilowski/flask-serverless">https://github.com/alexmilowski/flask-serverless</a> as necessary.</p>
<p>The key takeaway is that you can deploy Flask applications with minimal changes on Serverless. Any
changes that are necessary have to do with architectural changes for Serverless infrastructure. That
typically comes from the fact that there is no local environment so configuration or
local resources (e.g., files) need to be handled differently.</p>
<p>Also, the SF Microservices meetup is a great group of people. I enjoyed the talks and certainly
will attend again - you should too!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
