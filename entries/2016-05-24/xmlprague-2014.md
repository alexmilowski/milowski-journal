It has been far too long since I've written about my research, past or present, and I need to correct that.  I've been rather silent over the past year or more — life has kept me busy with other things.  As such, I have a backlog of information.

I'm back at it and you'll see more from me.  Meanwhile, this entry is a bit of a retrospective of research from my [Ph.D. dissertation](https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/9957) at the [University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics](http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) as presented at the [XML Prague 2014 conference](http://www.xmlprague.cz/archive/).

My thinking has evolved.  I would use [JSON-LD in](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/) addition to [RDFa](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-lite/) which I will elucidate in a forthcoming post on my Semantic Hybridization idea.  Moreover, I would  enable [CSV on the Web](http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/) as an additional way to transport tuples of data (rows).

I've included the presentation below and the [full conference paper](http://archive.xmlprague.cz/2014/files/xmlprague-2014-proceedings.pdf) is available as well.  Enjoy!
