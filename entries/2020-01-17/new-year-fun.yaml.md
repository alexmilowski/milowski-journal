  I've been playing around with Property Graphs and Cypher over the last
  year. In December 2019, I started a new job as Product Evangelist for
  Redis Labs. As such, I now get to work directly with an excellent
  implementation of a graph database: [RedisGraph](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgraph/)
