# Web-based Editor for Atomojo

I just finished a web-based editor for the Atom Publishing Protocol that is part of Atomojo.  I've also integrated it with the Atomojo server.  You can now just add the `edit-client='true'` attribute to any `host` or `resource` declaration in your `server.conf` and it will configure the editor on the `/edit/` path of your server.
