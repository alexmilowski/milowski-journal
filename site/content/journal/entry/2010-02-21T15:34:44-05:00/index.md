# Using contenteditable in Atomojo's Editor

I just added the use of WYSIWIG editing to the content editor for entries with XHTML content.  The `contenteditable='true'` is really simple and works very well in browsers like Safari or Firefox.  Given that I only use non-broken browsers to edit my feeds, this will work well.
