      <p>Here you'll find a variety of articles I've written over the years (see the <a href="/journal/">chronological list</a>). The site is organized as a very 
         simple blog (old school) and below are few of the first entries listed in chronological order. You can find site keywords and more information about me in the upper right.</p>
